I participated in the **51st Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IECON 2025)**, held from **October 14-17, 2025** in Madrid, Spain.

IECON is the flagship yearly conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, devoted to the dissemination of new ideas, research and works in progress in fields including Robotics and Mechatronics, Power Electronics, Cybersecurity, Renewable Energy, Smart Grid, Digital Twins, AI for Industrial Processes, and Industry 5.0.

## Conference Highlights

The conference program included workshops, tutorials, panels, keynotes, and presentations of original research and industrial applications. Madrid provided an excellent backdrop for networking with the world's industry, research, and academia professionals.

The paper was published in IEEE Xplore and is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11221467).
