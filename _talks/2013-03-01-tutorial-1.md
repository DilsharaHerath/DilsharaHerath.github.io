During the session, we explored:
- **The Transformative Role of AI** in Academic Research & Projects  
- **Enhancing Workflows** with AI-Driven Research Tools  
- **Modern AI Toolkits** and Their Practical Applications  
- **Prompt Engineering Techniques** for Generative AI in Research  

It was inspiring to witness such active participation—questions ranged from dataset curation to deploying models in resource-constrained environments. A huge thank you to everyone who joined and contributed their insights!
