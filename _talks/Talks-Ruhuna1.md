I conducted a virtual workshop on **"How AI is Transforming Research Workflows"** for the Electrical & Information Engineering Society at the University of Ruhuna on **June 30, 2025**, with over **70 participants** attending live.

## Session Overview

The workshop explored practical applications of artificial intelligence in academic research and project development, covering:

- The transformative role of AI in academic research and engineering projects
- AI-driven research tools and workflow enhancement techniques
- Modern AI toolkits and their practical applications
- Prompt engineering techniques for generative AI in research contexts

The session featured interactive discussions with participants asking questions ranging from dataset curation strategies to deploying AI models in resource-constrained environments.
