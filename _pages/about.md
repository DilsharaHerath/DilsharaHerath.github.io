 I am a fresh graduate from the **Electrical and Information Engineering** at the [University of Ruhuna](https://www.eng.ruh.ac.lk/) holding a **First-Class Honours**, (GPA 3.79/4.00). Currently I work as a **Research Assistant and Project Coordinator** at the [Multidiscplinary AI Research Centre (MARC)](https://marcuop.netlify.app/) at the [University of Peradeniya](https://eng.pdn.ac.lk/).

I am interested in technology-driven **machine learning, signal processing, computer vision, and AI-driven applications**.
