I’m a self-motivated AI researcher and engineer with a BSc in Electrical & Information Engineering from the University of Ruhuna (GPA 3.79/4.0). I specialize in machine learning and computer vision, with hands-on experience in sensing systems, deep neural networks, and real-time image processing. I love pushing the boundaries of AI to solve practical problems—everything from drone detection to drowsiness monitoring.
